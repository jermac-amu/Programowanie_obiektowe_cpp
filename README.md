### Requirements:

C++ compiler (e.g. gcc, g++, clang)
<br/>CMake >= 3.31

### To build all programs and libraries:

Navigate to repository root directory, then run:
<br/>`cmake -B build`
<br/>`cmake --build build`

Ready-to-run files can then be found in `./build` under their corresponding subdirectories.
<br/>All programs should be ran from the context of root directory, since paths to required input files are relative.
